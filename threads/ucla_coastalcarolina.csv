This ain't related to the game at all, but I need some advice. Been seeing this girl for a while now and she has some pros and cons:

**Pros:**

- Owns a home (not a huge or expensive one; one of those old 900sf townhouses from like 100 years ago that has been remodeled. Stiill - impressive for anyone our age to own a home)

- Great job with great income

**Cons:**

- She is kind of annoying and bossy

- I'm not really physically attracted to her anymore

- I knew she had cats when I started dating her, but I didn't realize she had **five**. And she lets them run all over her house. And I start itching and breaking out in hives and getting stuffed up whenever I am over there for more than a few hours.

I was thinking of ending things, but I wanted to do it in person. She texted me today asking if I could possibly meet her and her parents tomorrow.

I really don't want to end things over the phone. But I really also don't want to meet her parents when I am planning on ending things.",0,jywr18w,t3_168jxt0,t1_jywr18w,t3_168jxt0,/r/CFB/comments/168jxt0/game_thread_coastal_carolina_ucla_1030_pm_et/jywr18w/,5,5

This ain't related to the game at all, but I need some advice. Been seeing this girl for a while now and she has some pros and cons:

**Pros:**

- Owns a home (not a huge or expensive one; one of those old 900sf townhouses from like 100 years ago that has been remodeled. Stiill - impressive for anyone our age to own a home)

- Great job with great income

**Cons:**

- She is kind of annoying and bossy

- I'm not really physically attracted to her anymore

- I knew she had cats when I started dating her, but I didn't realize she had **five**. And she lets them run all over her house. And I start itching and breaking out in hives and getting stuffed up whenever I am over there for more than a few hours.

I was thinking of ending things, but I wanted to do it in person. She texted me today asking if I could possibly meet her and her parents tomorrow.

I really don't want to end things over the phone. But I really also don't want to meet her parents when I am planning on ending things.",0,jywr18w,t3_168jxt0,t1_jywr18w,t3_168jxt0,/r/CFB/comments/168jxt0/game_thread_coastal_carolina_ucla_1030_pm_et/jywr18w/,5,5

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",0,jywt2c9,t3_168jxt0,t1_jywt2c9,t3_168jxt0,/r/CFB/comments/168jxt0/game_thread_coastal_carolina_ucla_1030_pm_et/jywt2c9/,10,10

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",0,jywt2c9,t3_168jxt0,t1_jywt2c9,t3_168jxt0,/r/CFB/comments/168jxt0/game_thread_coastal_carolina_ucla_1030_pm_et/jywt2c9/,10,10
